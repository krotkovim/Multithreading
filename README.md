# Multithreading

Multithreading Project

This project demonstrates the use of ForkJoinPool to solve recursive tasks.

Description
The goal of this project was to create a multithreaded application that generates a map of a given website (list of links) and saves it to a file. The links to child pages should be listed in the file with one tabulation indentation relative to their parent page.

Requirements
JDK 11 or higher

What I did
Created a new project in the Multithreading directory.
Implemented a multithreaded application that generates a map of a website and saves it to a file.
Used ForkJoinPool to solve recursive tasks.
Listed the child pages with one tabulation indentation relative to their parent page.

Technologies and tools used
Java 11
Maven
ForkJoinPool

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates my ability to use ForkJoinPool to solve recursive tasks in a multithreaded environment. I successfully implemented a program that generates a map of a website and saves it to a file with correct indentation for child pages.
